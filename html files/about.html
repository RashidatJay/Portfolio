         <h2>About me</h2>
         
           <p> I''m a a front-end developer and freelance writer.  I delved into front-end development six months ago after becoming fascinated by the idea of building things on the web. My focus is on producing engaging, accesible and functional interfaces for all individuals.</p>
             <p>Besides participating in tech programs to acquire technical and soft skills, i have gained a good level of understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript from online courses on Udemy and Plural site.</p>
   
            <p>As for writing, I have been a freelance writer for over two years and specialize in esports and technical articles. I have worked for several sites including Upcomer, Esportsgg and Blixgg. When i'm not coding or writing, i am mostly gaming or surfing the web.</p>
